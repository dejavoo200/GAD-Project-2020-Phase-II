Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine
Objectives
In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

- Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

- Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

- Connect between the two instances.
Steps:
Create a virtual machine using the Google cloud Platform (GCP) Console.
    gcloud compute instances create my-vm-1 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20200902" --image-project "debian-cloud" --subnet "default" --tags http

    gcloud compute firewall-rules create default-allow-http --direction=INGRESS --network=default --action=ALLOW --rules=tcp:80 --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 --target-tags=http
Create a Computer Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.
    gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b

    gcloud compute instances create my-vm-2 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20200805" --image-project "debian-cloud" --subnet "default"
Connect between the two instances.

Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:

- Connect to my-vm-2:

    gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2
- ping my-vm-1 from my-vm-2:

    ping -c 4 my-vm-1
- Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-wm-1 from my-vm-2:

    ssh my-vm-1
- At the terminal on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web browser:

    sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y
- Use the nano editor to add a custom message to the homepage of the web server:

    sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
- Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header. Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:

    Hi from YOUR_NAME
- Exit the editor

Press Ctrl+O, then press Enter to save your edited file, then press Ctrl+X to exit the nano editor
- Confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:

    curl http://localhost/
- Result:
    The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.
- To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:

    exit
- To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:

    curl http://my-vm-1/
Now get the external IP of the my-vm-1 instance from this command:

    gcloud compute instances list --zone=us-central1-a
Paste the copied IP address of my-vm-1 into a new browser tab and hit Enter:

Result: You will your web server's home page, including your line of custom text.
